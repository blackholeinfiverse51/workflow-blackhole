  avgCompletionTime: calculateAvgCompletionTime(tasks),
  tasksByDepartment: groupTasksByDepartment(tasks),
  tasksByUser: groupTasksByUser(tasks),
  completionRate: (completed / total) * 100,
  overdueRate: (overdue / total) * 100,
};
```

#### Step 2: Update System Prompt
```javascript
**Task Analytics:**
- Average completion time: ${taskAnalytics.avgCompletionTime} days
- Department workload: ${JSON.stringify(taskAnalytics.tasksByDepartment)}
